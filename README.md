In this project, I have created a GAN using Celeba dataset from Kaggle.
The model creates fake human images which look just real but the image pixel quality is not that much good as its a very basic GAN.

## Tips:
Try running it on Google Collab so that you can easily train the model on GPU. Otherwise its gonna crash your jupyter notebook.
